# Building sustainable cities: Data Science to the rescue.

Using data from INEGI and developed using QGIS, this project presents some of
Mexico City geostatistical information as visual maps. The main features
presented are: alcald√≠as, educational level per AGEB (basic geo statistical area),
public hospitals heatmap, private hospitals heatmap and a combined heatmap,
with geolocated points with a 2k meters buffer around each hospital.
